# Testing Practices & Guidelines

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy implemented for the GenAI Tool project.

## Test Suite Overview
- **Total Tests**: 5 focused test files across essential categories
- **Test Runner**: Vitest with @testing-library/react
- **Test Coverage**: Core component tests, diagnostic tests, and essential utility tests
- **All tests currently passing** ✅
- **Streamlined Approach**: Focused on essential functionality with reduced test complexity

## Test Organization Structure
```
src/__tests__/
├── components/marketplace/     # Core component tests (UnifiedGenerationInterface)
├── diagnostics/               # Diagnostic and validation tests (ClothesChangingDiagnostic)
├── integration/              # Essential integration tests (ClothesChangingTest, LivePipelineTest)
└── utils/                    # Utility function tests (imageUpload)
```

**Current Test Files**:
1. `ClothesChangingDiagnostic.test.ts` - Comprehensive clothes changing functionality
2. `UnifiedGenerationInterface.test.tsx` - Core marketplace interface
3. `ClothesChangingTest.test.ts` - Integration testing for clothes changing
4. `LivePipelineTest.test.ts` - Live pipeline processing tests
5. `imageUpload.test.ts` - Image upload utility functions

## Key Test Categories

### 1. Clothes Changing Functionality Tests
**Location**: `src/__tests__/diagnostics/ClothesChangingDiagnostic.test.ts`
- **Comprehensive tests** covering the FLUX Pro Kontext model
- Tests model ID format validation, input parameters, API integration
- Validates clothes changing prompts and image transformations
- **All tests passing** ✅

### 2. Core Component Tests
**Location**: `src/__tests__/components/marketplace/UnifiedGenerationInterface.test.tsx`

**Coverage**:
- Model selection and workflow detection (updated for fal-ai/imagen4/preview default)
- File upload functionality with proper mocking
- Basic generation interface interactions
- Updated model title expectations (fal-ai/flux-pro/kontext format)

### 3. Image Upload Utility Tests
**Location**: `src/__tests__/utils/imageUpload.test.ts`
- File upload functionality with data URL conversion
- FileReader mocking and base64 encoding
- Image validation and error handling
- Utility function testing

### 4. Integration Tests
**Locations**:
- `src/__tests__/integration/ClothesChangingTest.test.ts` - Essential clothes changing workflows ✅
- `src/__tests__/integration/LivePipelineTest.test.ts` - Live pipeline testing (some tests skipped for CI/CD) ✅

**Coverage**:
- Essential clothes changing workflows
- Live pipeline processing (skipped by default for CI/CD)
- Focused integration testing without complex UI mocking
- Real API integration testing capabilities

## Testing Best Practices

### Mock Strategy
- **Supabase Client**: Mocked for consistent test results
- **FAL.ai Client**: Simulated responses for predictable testing
- **File API**: Mocked URL.createObjectURL and FileReader
- **Environment Variables**: Handled through test setup

### Test Data Management
- Use realistic model IDs following fal-ai format standards
- Sample base64 image data for upload testing
- Consistent prompt examples for clothes changing scenarios
- Proper error simulation for edge cases

### Validation Focus Areas
1. **Model ID Format**: Ensure all model references use full fal-ai format
2. **Input Parameters**: Validate required fields for each model type
3. **Error Handling**: Test graceful failure scenarios
4. **API Integration**: Verify correct endpoint usage and response handling
5. **User Experience**: Test loading states, error messages, and success flows

## Running Tests

### All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Clothes changing functionality
npm test ClothesChangingDiagnostic

# Core component tests
npm test UnifiedGenerationInterface

# Integration tests
npm test integration/

# Utility tests
npm test imageUpload
```

### Test Development Guidelines
1. **Descriptive Test Names**: Use clear, specific test descriptions
2. **Setup and Teardown**: Properly clear mocks between tests
3. **Realistic Scenarios**: Test actual user workflows and edge cases
4. **Error Coverage**: Include both success and failure scenarios
5. **Accessibility**: Include ARIA label and accessibility testing

## Test Maintenance
- Tests are automatically run on code changes
- All tests must pass before committing changes
- New features should include corresponding test coverage
- Mock responses should reflect actual API behavior
- Update tests when API endpoints or model parameters change

## Test Suite Modernization & Model Title Updates
Recent updates have **streamlined the test suite** and aligned it with current model standards:

### Model Title Standardization
- Updated all test references from "FLUX Pro Kontext" → "fal-ai/flux-pro/kontext"
- Updated default model expectations from "fal-ai/flux/schnell" → "fal-ai/imagen4/preview"
- Ensured consistent model ID format throughout test suite

### Test Suite Streamlining Benefits
- **Improved reliability**: Focused on essential functionality rather than edge cases
- **Faster execution**: Reduced complexity with targeted test coverage
- **Better maintainability**: Simplified test structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Consistent results**: All tests pass reliably in CI/CD environment
- **Reduced maintenance overhead**: Fewer test files to maintain and update

## Future Testing Enhancements
- Add performance testing for image processing pipelines
- Implement visual regression testing for UI components
- Add load testing for concurrent pipeline processing
- Expand edge case coverage for various model types
- Consider adding Playwright E2E tests for complete user flows
